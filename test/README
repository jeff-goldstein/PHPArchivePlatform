The email test harnes is a simple command line application that sends 'x' number of emails; depending on what you set in the for loop
on line 3.  This will allow you to do simple testing or even stress testing if you wish.  For high volume stress testing, you will
probably want to run this command in parallel in order to get the throughput you expect.

It will then:

  1) Randomly pick an email to send 
  2) Update the email with an UID that will tie the original email to the archive
  3) Pull in the SWAK command line template and update it with the same UID
  4) Send the email
  
The only three configurations that you will need are:

  1) You will need SWAKS installed and change the harnes code to point to your SWAKS installation.  
  2) You will also need to update the harness code with a SparkPost API key with SMTP rights.
  3) Set line three to reflect the number of emails you want to send.

Once everything is installed, simply call the harnes code 'emailtestharnes.php' from the command line and watch your code at work.
